# Overview of software for screening large amounts of textual data implementing machine learning 

The repository aims to create an overview and comparison of software used for
systematically screening large amounts of textual data using machine learning.

# Overview

The table below provides a quick overview of the software. The following
properties are evaluated:

-   Is there a website?
-	Is the software free and [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) (provide a :link: to the source code)?
-	Is the software published in a scientific article (provide a :link: with the [DOI](https://www.doi.org/))?
-	Is documentation or a manual available (provide a :link:)?
-	What type of machine learning is applied in the software (choose from **S**upervised, **U**nsupervised, **A**ctive)? – more details are compared in the tables about the [ML-properties](machine-learning-properties)
-	Is the user in control of the machine learning (yes/no, add `+` if users can add their own models)?

<sup>1</sup> Switching to a different model in ASReview is available by exporting the data of the first model and importing the data back into ASReview.
The software will recognize all previous labeling decisions, and a new model can be trained.

# Software

This section briefly describes the software in alphabetical order.

## [ASReview](www.asreview.ai)

 ASReview, developed at Utrecht University, helps scholars and practitioners
 to get an overview of the most relevant records for their work as efficiently
 as possible while being transparent in the process. It allows multiple
 machine learning models, and ships with exploration and simulation modes,
 which are especially useful for comparing and designing algorithms.
 Furthermore, it is intended to be easily extensible, allowing third parties
 to add modules that enhance the pipeline with new models, data, and other
 extensions.

## [Abstrackr](https://github.com/bwallace/abstrackr-web)

Abstrackr is a collaborative (i.e., multiple reviewers can simultaneously
screen citations for a review), web-based annotation tool for the citation
screening task.

## [Colandr](https://hslib.jabsom.hawaii.edu/colandr)

Colandr is a free, web-based, open-access tool for conducting evidence
synthesis projects. 

## [EPPI-Reviewer](https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=2914)

EPPI-Reviewer is a web-based software program for managing and analysing data
in literature reviews. It has been developed for all types of systematic
review (meta-analysis, framework synthesis, thematic synthesis etc) but also
has features that would be useful in any literature review. It manages
references, stores PDF files and facilitates qualitative and quantitative
analyses such as meta-analysis and thematic synthesis. It also contains some
new ‘text mining’ technology which is promising to make systematic reviewing
more efficient.

## [FASTREAD](https://github.com/fastread/src)

FASTREAD (FAST2) is a tool to support primary study selection in systematic
literature review.

## [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/)

Rayyan is a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening 
of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating 
a high level of usability.

## [RobotAnalyst](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/robotanalyst/)

RobotAnalyst was developed as part of the Supporting Evidence-based Public
Health Interventions using Text Mining project to support the literature
screening phase of systematic reviews.

## [SWIFT-Review](https://www.sciome.com/swift-review/) 

SWIFT-Review (SWIFT is an acronym for “Sciome Workbench for Interactive
computer-Facilitated Text-mining”) is a freely available interactive workbench
which provides numerous tools to assist with problem formulation and
literature prioritization.
