# Overview of machine learning for screening text software 

The repository aims to create an overview and comparison of software used for
systematically screening large amounts of textual data using machine learning.

# Overview

The table below provides a quick overview of the software. The following
properties are evaluated:

-	Is the software free and [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) (provide a :link: to the source code)?
-	Is the software published in a scientific article (provide a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/))?
-	Is documentation or a manual available (give a :link:)?
-	What type of machine learning is applied in the software (choose from **S**upervised, **U**nsupervised, **A**ctive)? â€“ more details are compared in the tables about the [ML-properties](machine-learning-properties)
-	Is the user in control of the machine learning (yes, no, and add a `+` if users can add their own models)?



| Software | Open-Source | Published | Documentation | Type of ML | Control over ML | Multi-user | 
|:--------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:---------------:|:----------:|


:white_check_mark: Yes/Implemented
:x: No/Not implemented
:zap: With some effort (add a :link: to more explaination)
:grey_question: Unknown (requires an issue)


# Installation

The table below provides an overview of options how to install the software.

- Can the software be installed locally so that data and labeling decisions are only stored on the users' device (yes/no)?
- Can the software be installed on a server (yes/no; provide a :link: to instructions)?
- Is a docker available (yes/no; provide a :link:)?
- Does the software run on a server with a SAAS (yes/no; provide a link to the registration page)?

| Software | Locally | Server | Docker | SAAS |
|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:----:|


:white_check_mark: Yes
:x: No
:grey_question: Unknown (requires an issue)
