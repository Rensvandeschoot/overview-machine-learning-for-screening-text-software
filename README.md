# Overview of machine learning for screening text software 

The repository aims to create an overview and comparison of software used for
systematically screening large amounts of textual data using machine learning.

# Overview

The table below provides a quick overview of the software. The following
properties are evaluated:

-	Is the software free and [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) (provide a :link: to the source code)?
-	Is the software published in a scientific article (provide a :link: with the [DOI](https://www.doi.org/))?
-	Is documentation or a manual available (provide a :link:)?
-	What type of machine learning is applied in the software (choose from **S**upervised, **U**nsupervised, **A**ctive)? – more details are compared in the tables about the [ML-properties](machine-learning-properties)
-	Is the user in control of the machine learning (yes/no, add `+` if users can add their own models)?

The tables below provides an overview of the machine learning properties.


## Active Learning

[^1]: Extracting the feature matrix in ASReview is available via an [extension](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-extension-vocab-extractor). 

[^2]: Switching to a different model in ASReview is available by exporting the data of the first model, and importing the data back into ASReview. The software will recognize all previous labeling decisions and a new model can be trained.

# Software

This section briefly describes the software in alphabetical order.

## [ASReview](www.asreview.ai)

 ASReview, developed at Utrecht University, helps scholars and practitioners
 to get an overview of the most relevant records for their work as efficiently
 as possible while being transparent in the process. It allows multiple
 machine learning models, and ships with exploration and simulation modes,
 which are especially useful for comparing and designing algorithms.
 Furthermore, it is intended to be easily extensible, allowing third parties
 to add modules that enhance the pipeline with new models, data, and other
 extensions.
 
 ## [Abstrackr](https://github.com/bwallace/abstrackr-web)

Abstrackr is a collaborative (i.e., multiple reviewers can simultaneously
screen citations for a review), web-based annotation tool for the citation
screening task. 

## [Rayyan](rayyan.ai)

 Rayyan is a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability.
